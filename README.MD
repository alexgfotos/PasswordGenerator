For this assignment we were required to create a random PW generator using JS.  The requirements were:

    *8-128 character length
    * be able to generate only lowercase
    * be able to generate only uppercase
    * be able to generate only numbers
    * be able to generate only symbols
    * be able to generate any combination of the previous four options.

I followed this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKo9pDKKHnc and made a fresh index and CSS file.
    - The video made all lower case the default so I added a lowercase selector and made the default an array that point to ASCII character code "null"

    - Bootstrap disagreed with some of the elements, I spent sometime trying to clean it up.  I needed Bootstrap for media query/responsiveness

    - PW display box does to constrain the text (longer pw would spill out).  I made the box bigger and the text smaller, what is the more elegant solution?

    - upload to github broke CSS, I had to add a CSS reset file
 
    - If I had used the provided file I could have saved some time (oops) but I did relearn and practice some design stuff!
